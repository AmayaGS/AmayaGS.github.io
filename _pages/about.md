I'm a final year PhD student at the [Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/) of Queen Mary University of London. I work at the intersection of :computer: AI, :seedling: biology and :pill: health!  My PhD supervisors are Professors [Michael Barnes](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/barnesmichael.html), [Myles Lewis](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/lewismyles.html) and [Greg Slabaugh](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/)

### Research focus

My research focus currently lays in developing biologically aligned, explainable deep learning algorithms for multistain histopathology data and transcriptomics of autoimmune disease's. I work in hope AI research will help us understand the complex, wonderful world of biology, immunology and pathogenesis âœ¨ :dizzy:
