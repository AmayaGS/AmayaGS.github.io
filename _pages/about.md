I'm a final year PhD student at the [Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/) of Queen Mary University of London. I work at the intersection of AI, health and biology! My PhD supervisors are Professors [Michael Barnes](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/barnesmichael.html), [Myles Lewis](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/lewismyles.html) and [Greg Slabaugh](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/)

## Research Interests

My research interest lays in developing deep learning strategies for multi-stain histopathology data and transcriptomics. I focus on Graph Neural Network approaches, seeking to leverage their flexibility and abilitity to integrate diverse, high dimensional data. I concentrate on immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sj√∂gren's Disease.
